# libpkgstate-source

`libpkgstate-source` provides sealed package-source authority admission into durable installed state.

```text
sealed libpkgsource snapshot -> package_source_record
```

It is a translation boundary, not a second authority. It performs no source discovery, dependency resolution, build or application execution, target mutation, state publication, migration, or compatibility import beyond the exact operation documented in `docs/architecture.md`.

The 3.0 repository was extracted from `libpkgstate` 2.5.1 without rewriting the implementation body.

## Build

```sh
meson setup build -Ddefault_library=shared -Dlink_mode=shared
meson compile -C build
meson test -C build --print-errorlogs
```

Fallback subprojects are intentionally unsupported. Shared and static closures use separate build directories.
