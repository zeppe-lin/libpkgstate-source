# Contributing

Changes must preserve the authority contract in `docs/architecture.md`: `sealed libpkgsource snapshot + selected architectures -> package_source_record`.

Do not move endpoint authority, orchestration, policy selection, discovery, execution, persistence, migration, retry, or compatibility import into this repository. A convenience that reacquires or infers missing authority is a boundary violation even when it reduces caller code.

For a semantic change:

1. inspect the exact current endpoint APIs and implementation bodies;
2. state which invariant or refusal class changes;
3. add focused success and refusal tests;
4. update public declarations, manual, architecture, integration, and ABI records together;
5. review public and private dependency closure for shared and static consumers;
6. decide version and SONAME consequences explicitly.

Use C++17, POSIX shell for contract programs, GPL-3.0-or-later SPDX headers, and the checked-in formatting rules. Keep commits single-purpose and suitable for `git am` review.
