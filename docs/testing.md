# Testing

The behavior suite is the extracted `source_adapter_test.cpp` qualification from `libpkgstate` 2.5.1. Additional contracts compile every installed public header independently, verify project version and SONAME, inspect pkg-config closure, reject forbidden authority dependencies, validate repository hygiene, and check the extracted body against a recorded SHA-256 manifest.

Shared and static builds are separate. CI runs GCC and Clang and a real ASan/UBSan build.
