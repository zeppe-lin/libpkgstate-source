# Testing

Qualification is layered so a green runtime test cannot hide a damaged package boundary.

The behavior suite exercises successful projection and typed refusal paths. Public-header tests compile the umbrella and each installed header independently. Shared builds compare dynamic exports to `abi/libpkgstate-source.exports`, verify SONAME `1`, and audit direct `DT_NEEDED` edges. Static builds prove the complete private pkg-config closure.

Source contracts verify architecture placement, release metadata, repository hygiene, CI coverage, style, and root-commit extraction provenance. The provenance contract checks the root extraction against the recorded `libpkgstate` 2.5.1 hashes; it intentionally does not freeze current implementation files.

CI runs GCC and Clang in separate shared and static configurations, one optimized release configuration, and ASan/UBSan configurations. Installation qualification compiles a consumer against staged headers and metadata, checks every installed header, audits the shared boundary or static archive, and verifies installed manual and project documentation.

A release candidate is incomplete until the exact dependency tags used by CI exist and the whole matrix is green from clean build directories.

The documentation contract receives the include roots of the production
dependencies resolved by Meson before Clang parses public headers. Ambient
system-installed zoo headers are not accepted as dependency closure.
