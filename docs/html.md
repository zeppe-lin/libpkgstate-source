# HTML documentation

The `html_docs` Meson feature builds a versioned static documentation tree for
libpkgstate-source. The tree is generated from the repository's authoritative Markdown,
canonical scdoc-derived manual mirrors, public headers, legal notices, and
Doxygen configuration.

Generation is atomic. The checker rejects missing inventory entries, broken or
escaping local links, leaked source/build paths, and source-format links. The
installed tree is placed below:

```
share/htmldocs/libpkgstate-source/3.0.0
```

HTML output is derived. Edit the Markdown, scdoc, headers, or Doxygen source and
regenerate; never patch generated HTML.
