# ABI policy

`libpkgstate-source` is an independently released C++17 shared and static library. Release 3.0.0 preserves SONAME generation `1` from the formerly in-tree product.

The reviewed ELF export set is stored in `abi/libpkgstate-source.exports`. Shared builds use hidden visibility and a generated version script; unreviewed implementation symbols must not escape. Any export addition, removal, signature change, exception hierarchy change, or public value-layout change requires an explicit ABI decision before release.

The pkg-config file is part of the installed contract. Public requirements are only those needed to compile installed declarations: `libpkgstate >=3.0.0` and `libpkgsource >=3.0.0`. Private requirements are none. Private requirements must not leak into ordinary shared-consumer flags, but they must appear in the static closure.

Repository version and SONAME generation are separate decisions. A repository-major extraction does not by itself require a new SONAME when the installed binary contract is preserved.
